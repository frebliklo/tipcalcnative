# Tip calculator - native

This is a small react-native project building upon an application I built while on vacation. Take a look at the repo for the [original project](https://github.com/frebliklo/tip-calculator).

## Why native

Because react-native is super fun! And incredibly easy with expo :)

## Currency

The app currently converts USD to DKK. It has a hardcoded exchange rate to set the initial state, but uses [CurrecyLayer](https://currencylayer.com/) to retrieve a live exchange rate. To do anything locally you need an api key, which you can get [here](https://currencylayer.com/product).
